# Data Science Technology Tree

A while back I had a chat where we started riffing on the complicated relationships between technology needed for today's high performing modern enterprises. My counterpart noted that, in some ways, transforming an organization to be digital native required something like a technology tree from "Age of Empires". Being much more a 4x game player myself, which typically have much more robust technology trees, I likened it to Civilization or Master of Orion. Not ever technology has an immediate payoff in terms of military units, but sometimes you need to learn diplomacy even if you'd rather just drop nuclear bombs on all your enemies.

This is an effort to codify some of those thoughts into something that is consumable for enterprises and hopefully be a useful tool to help them migrate to data science nirvana.
